# PMS Multi-Tenant Implementation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the changes made to implement multi-tenant architecture, improve data linking between modules, and enhance the user interface in the Property Management System (PMS).

## Key Implementations

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Added Tenant Model**: Created a new `Tenant` model in Prisma schema with fields for id, name, slug, and timestamps
- **Added TenantId to Models**: Added `tenantId` field to User, Property, RoomType, and Booking models
- **Tenant Isolation**: Implemented tenant isolation in backend services to ensure data security
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Enhanced RBAC to work with tenant context (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, MANAGER, STAFF)
- **Seed Script**: Created comprehensive seed script with 2 tenants, each with properties, room types, and bookings

### 2. Data Linking Between Modules

- **Booking-Property-RoomType Links**: Ensured proper relationships between Booking, Property, and RoomType
- **Required RoomTypeId**: Made roomTypeId required in Booking model and CreateBookingDto
- **Dropdown Integration**: Enhanced BookingForm to show RoomType dropdown filtered by selected Property
- **Cross-Module Validation**: Added validation to ensure RoomType belongs to selected Property and Tenant

### 3. Modal Popups

- **BookingDetailModal**: Created reusable modal for viewing booking details
- **ConfirmationModal**: Implemented standardized confirmation modal for delete operations
- **FormModal**: Developed flexible form modal for create/edit operations
- **Modal Integration**: Integrated modals with AllBookingsPage for a seamless user experience

### 4. Filter Synchronization

- **FilterContext**: Created a centralized FilterContext to manage filters across pages
- **URL Parameter Storage**: Implemented filter persistence through URL parameters
- **BookingFilters Component**: Enhanced BookingFilters with property, room type, status, date range filters
- **Filter Synchronization**: Ensured filters work consistently across all pages

### 5. TypeScript & Responsive Design

- **Fixed TypeScript Errors**: Resolved type issues in BookingTable, BookingForm, and contexts
- **Enhanced Responsive Design**: Improved mobile responsiveness in all components
- **Grid Layout**: Used Tailwind CSS grid for better responsive behavior
- **Consistent UI**: Standardized UI components across the application

## Testing & Validation

- **Tenant Isolation**: Verified that users from one tenant cannot access data from another tenant
- **Data Integrity**: Confirmed all bookings have proper links to properties and room types
- **Filter Functionality**: Tested filters to ensure they correctly filter data
- **Role-Based Access**: Validated that users can only access data according to their role and tenant

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/pms_backend/prisma/schema.prisma`: Added Tenant model and tenantId fields
- `/pms_backend/src/booking/dto/create-booking.dto.ts`: Updated DTO with required roomTypeId
- `/pms_backend/src/booking/booking.service.ts`: Enhanced with tenant isolation and validation
- `/pms_backend/src/booking/booking.controller.ts`: Updated to handle tenant context
- `/pms_backend/prisma/seed.ts`: Created comprehensive seed script

### Frontend
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/components/common/BookingDetailModal.tsx`: New component
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/components/common/ConfirmationModal.tsx`: New component
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/components/common/FormModal.tsx`: New component
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/contexts/FilterContext.tsx`: New context for filter management
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/components/Bookings/BookingFilters.tsx`: Enhanced filters
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/components/Bookings/BookingTable.tsx`: Improved with responsive design
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/pages/Bookings/AllBookingsPage.tsx`: Updated with modals and filters
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/contexts/BookingsContext.tsx`: Enhanced with tenant awareness
- `/extracted_files/frontend/src/hooks/useTenantIsolationTest.ts`: New hook for testing

## How to Test

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd pms_backend
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_tenant_model
   ```

2. **Seed the Database**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

3. **Test Multi-Tenant Isolation**:
   - Login as different users to verify tenant isolation:
     - Super Admin: superadmin@example.com / superadmin123
     - Admin A: admin.a@example.com / adminA123
     - Admin B: admin.b@example.com / adminB123
     - Manager A: manager.a@example.com / managerA123
     - Manager B: manager.b@example.com / managerB123

4. **Verify Data Links**:
   - Create a new booking and verify property/room type relationship
   - Edit a booking and check that room type dropdown filters by property
   - View booking details to confirm all relationships are displayed

## Next Steps

1. **Tenant Management UI**: Develop admin interface for managing tenants
2. **Enhanced Reporting**: Add tenant-aware reporting features
3. **User Assignment**: Create UI for assigning users to tenants
4. **API Documentation**: Update API documentation with tenant-related endpoints

## Conclusion

The PMS system now has a robust multi-tenant architecture with proper data isolation and enhanced user experience. The modular design allows for easy extension and maintenance while ensuring data security between tenants.
