# Sprint 01 - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This document outlines the initial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) defined for Sprint 01 of the PMS project. These KPIs aim to track progress, ensure quality, and align with the sprint goals of establishing a solid foundation for the backend core modules (Auth, Users).

## 1. Code Quality

*   **Unit Test Coverage (Backend):**
    *   **Target:** Achieve > 80% statement coverage for `AuthService` and `UsersService`.
    *   **Measurement:** To be measured using `jest --coverage` (or equivalent tool integrated into CI pipeline in later sprints). *Note: Actual measurement might be limited in the current sandbox environment.*
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures core authentication and user management logic is robust and less prone to regressions.
*   **Code Linting & Formatting:**
    *   **Target:** 0 linting errors and formatting issues reported by ESLint/Prettier upon code commit (enforced via pre-commit hooks - see Sprint 01 Governance tasks).
    *   **Measurement:** Pass/Fail status of linting checks in the pre-commit hook or CI pipeline.
    *   **Rationale:** Maintains consistent code style and prevents common coding errors.

## 2. Delivery & Progress

*   **Sprint Goal Completion:**
    *   **Target:** 100% completion of planned tasks for Sprint 01 (Environment setup verification, Auth module review & test, Users module implementation & test, Initial Governance setup, DB Backup/Restore documentation).
    *   **Measurement:** Tracking task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) in the project management tool or checklist.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures the sprint delivers the intended value and foundational work.
*   **Commit Frequency:**
    *   **Target:** Regular, meaningful commits throughout the sprint duration.
    *   **Measurement:** Reviewing commit history for consistency and clarity of commit messages.
    *   **Rationale:** Demonstrates steady progress and facilitates easier code reviews and rollbacks if needed.

## 3. Stability (Foundation for Future Sprints)

*   **Build Success Rate:**
    *   **Target:** 100% successful builds for committed code (initially manual builds, later automated in CI).
    *   **Measurement:** Pass/Fail status of local build commands (`npm run build` in backend/frontend) and later CI pipeline status.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures code integrates correctly and is deployable.
*   **Code Review Feedback Implementation:**
    *   **Target:** All critical/major feedback from code reviews (if applicable in this phase) is addressed before merging.
    *   **Measurement:** Tracking comments and resolutions in Pull Requests (once PR process is established).
    *   **Rationale:** Improves code quality through peer review.

*Note: These are initial KPIs for Sprint 01. They will be reviewed and potentially refined in the Sprint Retrospective and adapted for subsequent sprints as the project evolves and CI/CD capabilities are implemented.*
